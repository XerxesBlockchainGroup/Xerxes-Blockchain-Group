Welcome to the Xerxes Blockchain Group.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

Please keep all Xerxes Blockchain Group documentation on this site to avoid version control issues, especially around speaking engagement and coin development projects.
